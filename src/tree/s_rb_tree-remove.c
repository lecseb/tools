/**
 * 1) Perform standard BST delete. When we perform standard delete operation in
 *    BST, we always end up deleting a node which is either leaf or has only one
 *    child (For an internal node, we copy the successor and then recursively
 *    call delete for successor, successor is always a leaf node or a node with
 *    one child). So we only need to handle cases where a node is leaf or has
 *    one child. Let v be the node to be deleted and u be the child that
 *    replaces v (Note that u is NULL when v is a leaf and color of NULL is
 *    considered as Black).
 * 2) Simple Case: If either u or v is red, we mark the replaced child as black
 *    (No change in black height). Note that both u and v cannot be red as v is
 *    parent of u and two consecutive reds are not allowed in red-black tree.
 * 3) If Both u and v are Black.
 *   3.1) Color u as double black.  Now our task reduces to convert this double
 *       black to single black. Note that If v is leaf, then u is NULL and color
 *       of NULL is considered as black. So the deletion of a black leaf also
 *       causes a double black.
 *   3.2) Do following while the current node u is double black or it is not
 *        root. Let sibling of node be s.
 *        (a): If sibling s is black and at least one of siblingâ€™s children is
 *             red, perform rotation(s). Let the red child of s be r. This case
 *             can be divided in four subcases depending upon positions of s and
 *             r.
 *             (i) Left Left Case (s is left child of its parent and r is left
 *                 child of s or both children of s are red). This is mirror of
 *                 right right case shown in below diagram.
 *             (ii) Left Right Case (s is left child of its parent and r is
 *                  right child). This is mirror of right left case shown in
 *                  below diagram.
 *             (iii) Right Right Case (s is right child of its parent and r is
 *                  right child of s or both children of s are red)
 *        (b): If sibling is black and its both children are black, perform
 *             recoloring, and recur for the parent if parent is black.
 *        (c): If sibling is red, perform a rotation to move old sibling up,
 *             recolor the old sibling and parent. The new sibling is always
 *             black (See the below diagram). This mainly converts the tree to
 *             black sibling case (by rotation) and  leads to case (a) or (b).
 *             This case can be divided in two subcases.
 *             (i) Left Case (s is left child of its parent). This is mirror of
 *                 right right case shown in below diagram. We right rotate the
 *                 parent p.
 *            (iii) Right Case (s is right child of its parent). We left rotate
 *                 the parent p.
 *   3.3) If u is root, make it single black and return (Black height of
 *        complete tree reduces by 1).
